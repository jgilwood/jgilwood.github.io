# Why doesn't AI generated art carry the same emotional weight as human-made art?
## 
I have been making art my entire life and have considered myself an artist for more than half of it, and I have strong feelings on generative AI and art. I was almost opposed to doing this project because I have been so staunchly against the idea of even touching AI generated art, but I feel this is a chance for me to get a better perspective on generative AI and its use in art, something I believe will prove useful as I go into the world as an artist and have to face new conversations about the place AI will take in my practice.

The last two-ish years have spurred conversations between artists and non-artists over the merits of AI Art. To me, this was an easy position to take a stance on: I had spent years honing my skills and making hundreds of pieces of art to reach the point I was at then, and planned to spend many more years and create hundreds more pieces to reach a place I was even remotely satisfied with. The idea that AI could do any of that in less than a second terrified me, and terrifies me still, but to a far lesser extent. Now, this lessening of fear is not because I have “embraced AI”, but because I don’t think AI and AI Art has most, if any, of the skills a human has to create beautiful and meaningful art that resonates with people. Art is an innately human thing; Humans have been making art since we had the resources to do so, and that human need to create art—to beautify our spaces, to make our perspectives on the world be known—will never go away, even as generative AI looms on the horizon as a threat to the livelihoods of artists. 

This isn’t to say I don’t think AI can be used as a tool for artists, I do. I think that, if the power consumption of generative AI is better managed, a situation where an artist should have no problem turning to AI (AI that is trained on work that has been licensed out, not stolen from artists) could be possible. The main issue lies with the companies that employ artists, who now see AI as a simple way to cut the paychecks and hours of already underpaid and overworked artists—Companies who don’t care about the artistry or the merits or the value a human brings to their art, but simply for creating something appealing to put on a screen to drive up profits. 

My goal within this project is to take the time to examine my understanding of AI generated art more closely. I have had an inherent feeling that there is a difference between the art created by humans and generated by Artifical Inteligence, but this difference has so far been abstract and hard to understand fully. As I said before, I have never worked with generative AI to create images, so I have a very loose understanding on what it is like to work with a Large Language Model to generate images. By working with generative AI in a very hands-on way and comparing it against my own and others’ art, I hope to gain a better understanding of these differences and be able to organize my thoughts into cohesive anaysis. 

## An appreciation of human-made art: Rothko, Arcane Gold, Zurbarán, and JEB
### Rothko
<img src="img/RothkoOg">
I have many thoughts on this painting, much of it applying to Rothko’s art in general. Much like with most of Rothko’s art, this piece first gives me a profound sense of awe. At first glance, one sees a vibrant swath of a bright red contrasted against a deeper maroon and a dark blue. As you look closer, you can see hints of each individual light layer of paint built up to create incredible depth of color and within the piece in its entirety. Compared against earlier work by Rothko, a difference is clearly apparent. A shift away from his previous more lively pallets gives a new perspective to this piece, confronting the viewer with a new mixture of emotions: namely sadness, and a sense of grief and loss if you are familiar with Rothko’s life story. 

^revise all of that tbh

### Arcane Gold
<img src="img/LePrintempsOg">
<sub>Arcane Gold, Reimagining of Cot’s *Le Printemps* for *Classics…But Make It Gay* art book, 2021</sub>
<br>

My most surface-level feelings about this piece is simple adoration (The way this depiction of Achilles gazes upon Patroclus is not unlike the way I look at this piece). The lighting, the understanding of human form, the artist’s ability to take what was already a gorgeous painting and add their own perspective on it that only makes it more meaningful to me. To any who question the idea that digital art is true art, I raise this piece: the raw capturing of emotion, the use of color, form, light, shadow, all the traditional gauges of meaningful and beautiful art are on peak display here. I look at this, and I feel pride. Seeing an iconic depiction of pure love reimagined as queer and trans by a queer and trans artist fills me with such a strong sense of joy. I feel honored to have parts of myself represented in such a beautiful way. I am a sucker, for better or for worse, for religious imagery, especially in queer art, and the halo that faintly frames Achilles’ face, holding him, shown here as explicitly queer and trans, as close to Godliness, makes my breath catch in my throat. I really could look at this for hours (and have done so), trying to appreciate every single detail and trace every muscle or fold of fabric. To me, this is divine.

### Zurbaran
<img src="img/AgnusDeiOg">
What did I say! I like religious imagery! With this painting specifically, my love for it comes from the composition, the posing of the lamb. Yes, it is bound, but it doesn’t struggle against its bindings. Best as we can tell, it lies still, calm, maybe it has accepted this fate, or perhaps it wanted this fate all along. I cannot decide whether I feel pity for the lamb (pity for how it ended up in this position? Pity for its desire to stay?) or if I laugh at the lamb, I scorn it for its willingness to accept the promise that its life (and death) will mean something. Or maybe I feel I am the lamb, bound by an unseen presence, one I know must be there, but is not within frame, accepting the path my life has been set upon (do I wish to be pitied or scorned?). This lamb is holy, though we do not know why. Was it chosen for sacrifice by God, or by the shepard? Is the faint halo a true sign of divinity or an odd trick of the light? The scene around the lamb is in total darkness, and yet we see it in perfect light; is this, too, a sign of holiness? This painting leads me to an endless maze of questions, where each turn I take I am simply met with a new concept to ponder. 

### JEB
<img src="img/JEBOg">
To me, this photograph is so unbelievably tender and delicate, not for a lack of strength within the image, but for the pure power of the vulnerability shown in it. The subjects chose to let the photographer into their lives, chose to let her share it publicly. I’m sure I don’t have to explain the importance behind such a vulnerable display of queer love, especially in the time this was taken, so I won’t. Lesbian love isn’t something often portrayed so genuinely and full of heartfelt care as it is here. With the photographer, the subjects, and myself as the viewer all being lesbians, when I look at this, I feel a sense of security and safety. A moment of peace shared between people in community. Their body language shows peace: faces relaxed, not an ounce of tension in their positions, I can almost hear the quiet birds chirping and the slight rustle of the grass in the breeze, but not a sound more to disturb them. Whether intentional or not, heart imagery can be found everywhere within this image: from the way the lovers’ heads lie together, to the shape where one’s chin and shoulder meets the other’s. It gives me a sense of domesticity. Domesticity is something women (used here as a simple way to refer to the plethora of different genders that exist within womanhood and Lesbianism, not just classically binary women) are often relegated to. For centuries, the domestic work and existence of women has been something expected of them, and therefore undeserving of recognition. JEB’s photograph, however, is a moment of pause to appreciate this domesticity in only a way that someone who has existed within that domestic role truly can, pulling from JEB’s own life experiences as a Lesbian. It gives me a sense of hope. That someday I will be a comfortable, happy Lesbian, holding a lover in my arms, not for fear of losing them, but for the sheer fact that I love to hold them, because we understand each other in a way no one else does.

## An attempt at using generative AI

#### new intro about my doubts abt using AI to like preface everything yk yk yeahhhh

*'Generate an image of an oil painting made up of many light washes of colors, creating a vibrant final result that has some of the layers showing near the edge of the painting. The background of the painting is a deep purple. This background acts as a border around the central colors of the piece, which has a dark blue in the bottom quarter of the image and a bright red in the top three quarters of the image. Between the blue and red, the purple border extends to separate the two colors.'* **Google Gemini**

<img src="img/RothkoAI1">

This certainly isn’t flat or untextured, which is impressive for an AI generated image, but it still feels uninteresting. The original Rothko has depth and feeling. With this, I return to the intentionality behind the piece. The creation of Rothko’s work was meticulous and painstaking, layers upon layers of paint put down and dried and put down again. The generation of this image was near instant, and therefore makes me feel very little. I know thought and emotion didn’t go into this, and therefore I do not get any out of it. It doesn’t make me ponder the state of the artist, because I know this was made from just a few words and a Large Language Model to interpret them. Making this, I certainly don’t feel like an artist, and neither do I feel like the AI is an artist. This isn’t a glimpse into the mind of an individual (which is what any art is, arguably, whether it is technically “good” or not, whether it is intended to be or not) because the mind this came from and the tools that executed it are so disconnected that there is no fluid through-line. 

<img src="img/RothkoAI2">
I generated the first image with Google Gemini AI (mostly because ChatGPT only gives three free generations a day and I had used those daily generations up already), but out of curiosity fed the same prompt into ChatGPT the next day, and was given this: even though I never directly mentioned the phrases “abstract” or “abstraction” in my prompt, ChatGPT described the image as an “abstract oil painting”, but did create a more detailed image than I had originally intended for.

*'could you make the image simpler, more similar to a color field abstraction piece?'*

### ROthko AI 3

Now understanding that ChatGPT wants a more specific style regarding the abstraction of the image, I gave it that in a new prompt, and the result is… certainly closer in appearance. When I look at this, I am reminded of hotel art: a painting that is hung up in the hallway by the elevators that has no artist’s name near it so even if I felt strongly about the work I couldn’t look into the artist further, just nice enough to give me something to look at for no longer than the time it takes for the elevator to reach my floor and me to maybe point to and say “That looks pretty” to whoever I’m with. It feels like it's made for consumption. To have eyes glaze over it without any intention of really taking in the work, simply being there because the style is inoffensive and it looks nice enough and the colors match the wallpaper—the antithesis of how I understand a Rothko. Especially the painting I included here, Rothko’s works are meant to be seen and understood and taken in at a massive scale. They can be poured over for hours and still leave the viewer with a sense of wanting to understand and see more—I don’t want to look at this image for any longer than it takes me to write this analysis. It feels uninspired. 


*'Generate a painting in a classical-romantic style of two male lovers seated on a rope swing in the woods together. The smaller lover is blond and has his arms wrapped around his partner, wearing a classic Greek-inspired semi-transparent white linen wrap that hangs open around his arm, revealing scars from a double mastectomy on his chest. He looks at his lover with a face of pure adoration and love. His feet are tucked below him on the swing, with one ankle having an arrow piercing through it. Behind his head, a halo is faintly visible. The taller person has his hands wrapped securely around the rope of the swing, one foot kicked out in front of him and the other folded back. His face is barely visible to the viewer, instead looking down at the other individual. His hair is a dark brown and curly, and he wears orange cloth fitted like a shirt and shorts, with a brown wrap around his midsection. The couple is lit from behind, casting the front of their bodies in shadow and backlighting them in a warm yellow light. The forest behind them is lush and beautiful, with a large, sturdy tree nearby to the couple, holding up the swing off-screen'* **ChatGPT**

With this prompt I generated these two images (the second one with the request to *“adjust it so we are looking at them from a partial side angle”*):

<img src="img/LePrintempsAI1">
<img src="img/LePrintempsAI2">
These images are definitely interesting, and aesthetically pleasing to look at for sure, but they do not capture what I find to be so beautiful about the original piece. Ignoring some obvious things (like that ChatGPT did not seem to know what I meant by a “double mastectomy scar”, and instead put a strange mark onto one of the lover’s chest/back (and the wrong one for that matter)), there simply is not the same affection that is so powerful and palpable in the original image. The AI is able to get many technical things right—such as in the second iteration, the backlighting through the fabric is very pretty and is fairly impressive for the consistency (for lack of a better word) it shows, but the expressions of the people in each image are much more simple and do not have the same nuance of emotion as in the original piece (which, in all honesty, could be an issue on my behalf; iIt is entirely possible I just did not describe the expressions of the two characters well enough, but that is another issue with generative AI art. It is incredibly hard to make fine-tuned adjustments to anything in these images since, with every new generation, the image entirely changes, unlike in traditional art). A possible bias I noticed with these images is that ChatGPT seemingly interpreted when I described one of the lovers (the Achilles representation or “blond lover”) as being smaller than the other, it seemingly interpreted this as meaning this character was more feminine (or possibly younger?). The Patroclus representation, in both AI generations, has visible facial hair and body hair as well. The “smaller” lover, however, has no facial hair in either generation and no body hair in the second one. 


(for some reason, the line break isnt working here. fix that)


*‘Generate an image of a painting in a renaissance style of a white lamb on dark wood, with a black background behind it. The angle is slightly above the lamb, looking down at it lying on the surface. The legs of the lamb are tied together, though the lamb does not look to be in distress. Its visible ear is turned down in a sign of calmness and its chin rests on the wood surface. Above its head, there is a very faint halo that can barely be seen against the dark background. The painting has an air of solemnity.'* ChatGPT

<img src="img/AgnusDeiAI1">
My first attempt with this prompt missed what I feel are the two most key features of the painting: the tied legs of the lamb and the halo. Before picking into the way that this doesn’t inspire the same emotions in me the original does, I’ll focus on the technical aspects. With this, I’d love to point out one fairly common thread among AI generated art, the smoothness that accompanies the “AI art style”. The entire lamb feels as though it has been smoothed out almost. Even with the emulated paintrokes I can see over the image, it still feels very fake and artificial, in a  way even beyond the smoothness of human-made digital art (such as the previous Le Printemps piece which, despite being digital, still has varied textures and feels (for lack of a better word) genuine). The shadows have an odd harshness that make the lighting feel uncanny and draw my attention in a bad way. In regards to the emotions of the piece, what strikes me the most is how the difference in intentionality shifts the way I perceive the original work and this image. In the original, I know every bit of that work was an intentional and deliberate choice made by Zurbarán, which is what led me to have so many questions about the piece for the most part. But here, knowing that this work was made by an AI driven by a prompt without the direct involvement of an artist to make these deliberate decisions (the disconnect between the human prompter and the AI generating the image feels especially apparent in the way the image does not have two of the thing I had included in the prompt) leaves me with no yearning feeling to understand and analyze and interpret everything I am seeing—it makes me a passive observer (which is the antithesis of how I think art is best enjoyed, with the viewer actively digging into the piece in some way). 

<img src="img/AgnusDeiAI2">
I asked ChatGPT to regenerate the image with the modification that *'there is a halo above the lamb's head and its legs are tied together'* which gives me an interesting result. There is neither a halo nor are the lamb’s legs tied together, it simply zoomed the image in to be focused on the lamb’s head. I am curious about the way the AI seems unable to incorporate these two features (halo, legs tied) into the image. 

<img src="img/AgnusDeiAI3">
*'the image still does not have the halo or the lambs legs tied together, can you generate an image with these two features included.'*

<img src="img/AgnusDeiAI4">
Improvement, the halo is now present, but it’s lost the solemnity of the image, and the legs are still not tied. The AI seems to understand that the halo implies holiness, but that holiness implies a lighter or almost innocent appearance of the painting—the way the lamb now faces the viewer, its leg extended forward over the wood—it doesn’t seem to be able to understand the more nuanced idea that the original painting is portraying that something can be holy but not good. 

*'could you make the image feel more solemn again?'*

<img src="img/AgnusDeiAi5">
I think this better captures the artistic style of the original, somewhat,  but with the key difference of the lamb’s posture. This rendition has both the tied legs (not all of them, but good enough) and the halo (not quite faint, but once again good enough), and has a similar darkness that feels as though it should be solemn, but again it feels as though it lacks some integral human touch that brings the original piece together. The stillness within this image has a different sense of calm not present in Zurbarán’s original. The posture of the lamb, the AI having disregarded the instruction to have the lamb’s head on the ground, gives a feeling of pride to the lamb that is purposefully absent from the original. Even when I asked for a more solemn image, ChatGPT seems to be struggling with the idea of not making a holy or religious concept have a positive aura. 

The finickiness of the entire process of attempting to work a clear vision through AI leads me to simply feel frustration with this image; it isn’t entirely what I want still, and I anticipate another regeneration to simply result in another insufficient result. Even with this frustration, I wouldn’t say that this “art” causes me to feel much, it is rather the process and tools I am using that frustrates me. 



This work in particular is simply too beautiful and complex for me to even remotely understand how I could describe it in a way that would make it possible for an AI to generate anything even close to the original, in appearance and emotion. 

*'Generate a photo-realistic black and white image of two Black Lesbians lying in embrace together. They are on a dark blanket laid over grass, which is visible in the very top of the image. Their heads are close together and turned in profile, fitting together like puzzle pieces. The scene is well lit and feels tranquil, both of the individuals having a content look on their face. Their eyes are closed, almost as if they could be sleeping. One of the individuals is lying slightly on top of the other, with her arm outstretched over the companion. The image is cropped to be waist up.'* **ChatGPT**

Returned with: *'I encountered some issues generating the image as requested.'* alongside the above image.

### JEB ai

I am immediately fascinated by the bias apparent in this image. When asked to create an image with “two Black Lesbians”, ChatGPT created an image with two individuals who would be very classically read as men, the most telling feature being that they both appear to have facial hair. Now, I don’t personally believe that the individuals shown in this image could not be women and/or Lesbians (given that they were real people, of course, and not AI generated falsifications of people). Gender presentation and identity are complicated concepts that I believe exist over a huge spectrum. This is especially complicated within Lesbianism, which has a rich history of gender nonconformity and existing within or besides trans spaces. However, I don’t think ChatGPT believes this, and this grows clear when one considers other factors. Black women (and individuals who are societally grouped with or identified as women) have a long history of being viewed as more masculine than their white counterparts, a bias that easily could have been picked up by an AI model trained on databases curated by white people consciously or unconsciously upholding a white-supremacist idea. There are factors in the image that show a possible attempt at depicting these individuals as more classically women (namely that the figure on the upper half of the image seems to have some shading on their chest that might imply breasts), but at first glance, the average person would not read these as a Lesbian couple.

That the AI gave this image with the message that it “encountered some issues” tells me that there is something about the prompt making the image difficult for it to generate. Now, reasonably, it could be that ChatGPT simply has trouble generating photo realistic images or that my given prompt was not well enough written to be easily usable. It could also be that the database ChatGPT works off of does not have many examples of Black Lesbian couples for the AI to draw upon and, since generative AI is based on taking factors it has seen and combining them exactly as it knows those original elements, it cannot adequately create this image. Once again, I feel little for the image itself, and instead feel frustration and confusion (maybe a bit of curiosity, I won’t lie) over what went into this image on the backend of ChatGPT. 

*'could you make both individuals women?'*

### JEB ai 2

Sure! Better now! They’re classically women! And have weird puzzle piece looking bits on them, but I have no idea what that has to do with anything and assume it simply to be an AI defect (or another symptom of ChatGPT having few and/or poor resources on how to depict Black women as regular and human looking, but that would imply ChatGPT has a racial bias that disproportionately affects Black women, an idea we (nor anyone else) have seen no evidence of ever! [Black Artists Say A.I. Shows Bias, With Algorithms Erasing Their History - The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/04/arts/design/black-artists-bias-ai.html) oops! I accidentally linked an article!). Besides this, the image is bland. It doesn’t have the story and vulnerability of the original photograph. I really don’t have much more to say other than I am bored, utterly uninterested, and far more intrigued by the issues that came with generating it than the truly *nothingburger* image on my screen now.

## Is the AI an artist? Am I an Artist? 

None of this is art, and neither the AI nor myself are artists here. Art is a rewarding process that is meant to be reveled in. The process of art-making is just as, if not more, rewarding than the final product, a concept AI art advocates don’t seem to understand (probably because most of them aren’t artists and haven’t participated in an artistic practice). Going through the process of generating these images, I am not enjoying the process. The process is annoying and I would so much rather spent the next 100 hours of my life working on one piece of art than spend an hour making 100 attempts at creating my “ideal” AI piece. 

Sometimes there aren’t the right words to describe things—what you’re seeing, what you’re feeling, the contents of art. With human-made art (“real art”), that barrier most often does not exist. The artist is directly involved in the evolution of the (in this case) visual work they are creating. You don’t need to be able to describe the image: if you know what you want to create or you have some image in your head, you can work to put that image into the real world. Art is complex, it can’t be broken down into simple phrases for a generative AI to understand and compose into a final image. I have come to understand this as the root of the issue when people, myself included, say that AI art is flat or lifeless or just simply doesn’t feel like “real” art. 

The thousands of minute decisions that go into every instance of art making cannot be replicated in a prompt, cannot be replicated by an AI in the blink of an eye. Every work of art, whether it be a child’s crayon drawing or the Lascaux cave paintings, the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel or to the painting I am sitting in front of as I type this, is influenced by the life and experiences of that singular artist. It is a synthesis of all the art they have ever seen, held in their mind how they see it and remember it and work into something new. By design, a Generative AI Large Language Model cannot do this. An LLM like ChatGPT has an exact memory of any and all images it has access to, the antithesis of the trait that makes human creation of art unique and interesting. 

I see this best and more specifically in JEB’s photograph. On the surface, it is a relatively simple image: lovers in an embrace on the grass. But as I went to type out the prompt, I kept noticing little details that were all working together to build my love and understanding of the photograph. There are so many small things that came together just right in this moment of time and so many elements in this photo, I quickly became overwhelmed with the idea of describing all of them, and especially describing them in a way that would make an AI understand what I mean and the significance of the role that miniscule detail plays in the overall image. I don’t think anyone could adequately describe this photo, and I don’t think I could adequately describe what exactly it means to me. This work is visual, it is not a collection of words typed into a chatbox and could never be that. It could only be created in those original circumstances, on that grass with JEB and Prescilla and Regina together in this intimate moment. AI doesn’t factor into this. AI can’t do this.

AI simply isn’t built for this. It isn’t built to make art.

I find it quite difficult to capture the original emotion of the piece, which makes sense when you consider the broader context in which the piece was made. This is maybe my fifth time using PIL to generate an image from code. Most of my time that I've dedicated to working on this piece has been me simply trying to figure out how to get an image remotely similar to the original piece, not leaving me much time or space to put emotion into my piece. And this principle, or a similar one at least, is often true for any medium of art. When I first began painting, for example, my work was not very high quality—it did not carry the emotion I was intending, the colors were not harmonious how I wanted them to be; the pieces I created then did not convey what I wanted them to. This is simply a skill that comes with time, effort, and practice dedicated to an art form. In this sense, although this recreation does not make me feel the same emotions that the original Rothko did, I still view this as art and myself as an artist in a way contrary to how I felt about the art generated by AI. 

While more traditional human-made art (ie. the original Rothko piece) and this art (still made by a human, but in the medium of coding with Python Image Library) both take active participation, effort, and improvement on the part of the artist making the piece, work generated by AI has a rift between the “artist” and the “art” created. By creating a prompt to be handled by a separate entity, the “artist” (or as I would refer to them, “prompter”), puts themself into a far more passive role in the art making process. Though they can change the outcome by changing a few words in a prompt or adding on new instructions, the prompter cannot directly impact the piece the way an artist working on a painting or adjusting code can. The prompter can hope that the adjustment will have the desired outcome, but, as I’ve learned by working with AI, generative AI is finicky at best and uncooperative at worst. It doesn’t have the lived experiences of a person to draw upon and better the art intuitively and naturally through practice and experimentation. Instead, it must rely on the work of artists in the past to create anything new. When asked to create an image of something it was not trained well on, like creating a scene with two Black Lesbians as I tried with the JEB photograph or depicting a trans person like with Arcane Gold’s Le Printemps, it struggles in a way a human artist would not. A human artist either already has experience or exposure to a more diverse world than the databases that LLMs are trained on, or can seek out new sources and references to help themself improve. For the most part, a prompter has no control over what is or isn’t in the databases that trained the AI they use. Small adjustments could be made to these pieces if they were created with another medium, but, while generating images, AI is not aware of the “bigger picture” in the way a person is. Therefore, when asking for a small adjustment, the prompter receives back what is essentially an entirely different image (with varying success on the requested adjustments being made).
