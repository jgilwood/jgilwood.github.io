# Why doesn't AI generated art carry the same emotional weight as human-made art?
## 
I have been making art my entire life and have considered myself an artist for more than half of it, and I have strong feelings on generative AI and art. I was almost opposed to doing this project because I have been so staunchly against the idea of even touching AI generated art, but I feel this is a chance for me to get a better perspective on generative AI and its use in art, something I believe will prove useful as I go into the world as an artist and have to face new conversations about the place AI will take in my practice.

The last two-ish years have spurred conversations between artists and non-artists over the merits of AI Art. To me, this was an easy position to take a stance on: I had spent years honing my skills and making hundreds of pieces of art to reach the point I was at then, and planned to spend many more years and create hundreds more pieces to reach a place I was even remotely satisfied with. The idea that AI could do any of that in less than a second terrified me, and terrifies me still, but to a far lesser extent. Now, this lessening of fear is not because I have “embraced AI”, but because I don’t think AI and AI Art has most, if any, of the skills a human has to create beautiful and meaningful art that resonates with people. Art is an innately human thing; Humans have been making art since we had the resources to do so, and that human need to create art—to beautify our spaces, to make our perspectives on the world be known—will never go away, even as generative AI looms on the horizon as a threat to the livelihoods of artists. 

This isn’t to say I don’t think AI can be used as a tool for artists, I do. I think that, if the power consumption of generative AI is better managed, a situation where an artist should have no problem turning to AI (AI that is trained on work that has been licensed out, not stolen from artists) could be possible. The main issue lies with the companies that employ artists, who now see AI as a simple way to cut the paychecks and hours of already underpaid and overworked artists—Companies who don’t care about the artistry or the merits or the value a human brings to their art, but simply for creating something appealing to put on a screen to drive up profits. 

My goal within this project is to take the time to examine my understanding of AI generated art more closely. I have had an inherent feeling that there is a difference between the art created by humans and generated by Artifical Inteligence, but this difference has so far been abstract and hard to understand fully. As I said before, I have never worked with generative AI to create images, so I have a very loose understanding on what it is like to work with a Large Language Model to generate images. By working with generative AI in a very hands-on way and comparing it against my own and others’ art, I hope to gain a better understanding of these differences and be able to organize my thoughts into cohesive anaysis. 

## An appreciation of human-made art: Rothko, Arcane Gold, Zurbarán, and JEB
### Rothko
I have many thoughts on this painting, much of it applying to Rothko’s art in general. Much like with most of Rothko’s art, this piece first gives me a profound sense of awe. At first glance, one sees a vibrant swath of a bright red contrasted against a deeper maroon and a dark blue. As you look closer, you can see hints of each individual light layer of paint built up to create incredible depth of color and within the piece in its entirety. Compared against earlier work by Rothko, a difference is clearly apparent. A shift away from his previous more lively pallets gives a new perspective to this piece, confronting the viewer with a new mixture of emotions: namely sadness, and a sense of grief and loss if you are familiar with Rothko’s life story. 

^revise all of that tbh

### Arcane Gold

<sub>Arcane Gold, Reimagining of Cot’s *Le Printemps* for *Classics…But Make It Gay* art book, 2021</sub>

My most surface-level feelings about this piece is simple adoration (The way this depiction of Achilles gazes upon Patroclus is not unlike the way I look at this piece). The lighting, the understanding of human form, the artist’s ability to take what was already a gorgeous painting and add their own perspective on it that only makes it more meaningful to me. To any who question the idea that digital art is true art, I raise this piece: the raw capturing of emotion, the use of color, form, light, shadow, all the traditional gauges of meaningful and beautiful art are on peak display here. I look at this, and I feel pride. Seeing an iconic depiction of pure love reimagined as queer and trans by a queer and trans artist fills me with such a strong sense of joy. I feel honored to have parts of myself represented in such a beautiful way. I am a sucker, for better or for worse, for religious imagery, especially in queer art, and the halo that faintly frames Achilles’ face, holding him, shown here as explicitly queer and trans, as close to Godliness, makes my breath catch in my throat. I really could look at this for hours (and have done so), trying to appreciate every single detail and trace every muscle or fold of fabric. To me, this is divine.

### Zurbaran

What did I say! I like religious imagery! With this painting specifically, my love for it comes from the composition, the posing of the lamb. Yes, it is bound, but it doesn’t struggle against its bindings. Best as we can tell, it lies still, calm, maybe it has accepted this fate, or perhaps it wanted this fate all along. I cannot decide whether I feel pity for the lamb (pity for how it ended up in this position? Pity for its desire to stay?) or if I laugh at the lamb, I scorn it for its willingness to accept the promise that its life (and death) will mean something. Or maybe I feel I am the lamb, bound by an unseen presence, one I know must be there, but is not within frame, accepting the path my life has been set upon (do I wish to be pitied or scorned?). This lamb is holy, though we do not know why. Was it chosen for sacrifice by God, or by the shepard? Is the faint halo a true sign of divinity or an odd trick of the light? The scene around the lamb is in total darkness, and yet we see it in perfect light; is this, too, a sign of holiness? This painting leads me to an endless maze of questions, where each turn I take I am simply met with a new concept to ponder. 

### JEB

To me, this photograph is so unbelievably tender and delicate, not for a lack of strength within the image, but for the pure power of the vulnerability shown in it. The subjects chose to let the photographer into their lives, chose to let her share it publicly. I’m sure I don’t have to explain the importance behind such a vulnerable display of queer love, especially in the time this was taken, so I won’t. Lesbian love isn’t something often portrayed so genuinely and full of heartfelt care as it is here. With the photographer, the subjects, and myself as the viewer all being lesbians, when I look at this, I feel a sense of security and safety. A moment of peace shared between people in community. Their body language shows peace: faces relaxed, not an ounce of tension in their positions, I can almost hear the quiet birds chirping and the slight rustle of the grass in the breeze, but not a sound more to disturb them. Whether intentional or not, heart imagery can be found everywhere within this image: from the way the lovers’ heads lie together, to the shape where one’s chin and shoulder meets the other’s. It gives me a sense of domesticity. Domesticity is something women (used here as a simple way to refer to the plethora of different genders that exist within womanhood and Lesbianism, not just classically binary women) are often relegated to. For centuries, the domestic work and existence of women has been something expected of them, and therefore undeserving of recognition. JEB’s photograph, however, is a moment of pause to appreciate this domesticity in only a way that someone who has existed within that domestic role truly can, pulling from JEB’s own life experiences as a Lesbian. It gives me a sense of hope. That someday I will be a comfortable, happy Lesbian, holding a lover in my arms, not for fear of losing them, but for the sheer fact that I love to hold them, because we understand each other in a way no one else does.
